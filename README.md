# Environment Setup
You'll need to have ./scripts/setup.sh succeed at least once.

Then you can run ./register.sh whenever you bring a new shell here to register
the `pico` helper command.

After that, you can run `pico` commands from anywhere in the repo:

```bash
pico compile
pico upload
pico logs
# Or all of the above via:
pico run
```
